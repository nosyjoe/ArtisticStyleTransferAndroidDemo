# Artistic Style Transfer Android Demo
Demonstrates how to setup TensorFlow for artistic style transfer

## Android Demo App

Building the app should be straight-forward by opening the project in Android Studio or running `./gradlew assembleDebug` on the command line. Android SDK must be installed properly.

### Implementations

* [Logan Lengstr√∂m's fast style transfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) This is the one I ended up using since setting up the training was easy and the results great. It was also used to create the style.pb in this demo.
* Google's Magenta Model (allows mixing of styles): [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/image_stylization),  [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/11/01/multistyle-pastiche-generator/) and [Google Code Lab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-style-transfer-android/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#4)
* [neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style) has an implementation that allows tweaking of the result by specifying more parameters for the training process, like color-preserving or chaning the level of how abstract the result gets
